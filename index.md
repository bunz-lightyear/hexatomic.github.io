**"A minimal infrastructure for the sustainable provision of extensible multi-layer 
annotation software for linguistic corpora" (Hexatomic)** is a joint research project
at Friedrich-Schiller-Universit채t Jena and Humboldt-Universit채t zu Berlin.

It is funded under the call ["Research Software Sustainability"](http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding_opportunities/call_proposal_software/)
issued by [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft](http://www.dfg.de/en/) under grant
number GA 1288/11-1 and runs from October 2018 until September 2021. 

The project aims to implement, test, and document *a minimal infrastructure for
the sustainable development, provision, and maintenance of research software*.
The [complete project proposal is available as a PDF]({{ './assets/pdf/hexatomic_project_description_website.pdf' | relative_url }}).

This infrastructure will be used to provide the linguistic community with
*software for deep multi-layer annotation of linguistic corpora*.

The project is located at the 
[Department of English Studies](https://www.iaa.uni-jena.de/en/) (Jena) and the
[Department for German Studies and Linguistics](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/en) 
(Berlin).
